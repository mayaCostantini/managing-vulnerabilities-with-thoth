=  Managing Vulnerabilities with Thamos

[#introduce-vulnerability]
== Introducing a Vulnerability

The ``game_of_life.py`` program is a simple application that shows how Thamos manages known vulnerablities in the dependencies of a project. 
To use this example application, follow the steps mentioned above relative to the installation of the Thamos CLI and to its configuration using ``.thoth.yaml``.

To introduce voluntarily a known vulnerability in the project, specify that you would like to add pillow version 8.0.0 in your requirements:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
thamos add pillow==8.0.0

[.lines_space]
[.console-output]
[source,bash]
2022-01-12 14:20:11,248 [217578] INFO     thamos.lib: Adding 'pillow==8.0.0' to default requirements of runtime environment 'ubi8'

This version of pillow is known for introducing a vulnerability further described on the https://github.com/pypa/advisory-db[pypa/advisory-db] repository. 
Thamos can also manage user requirements for dependencies using https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#constraints-files[constraints files]. 
To add pillow version 8.0.0 in your dependency requirements this way, you can simply write the package with its version into this file.

[#thamos-resolution]
== Resolving Security Issues with Thamos

To get a stack guidance based on security, run the following command:

IMPORTANT: The resolution process might take some time as the resolver explores resolution possibilities in the dependency graph (unless cached results are already available).

Or modify the recommendation_type field to security in ``.thoth.yaml`` to set it as your default recommendation type, and simply run:

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
thamos advise

Thamos report should show that an error occurred during the resolution process because a known vulnerability was found in pillow version 8.0.0. Thoth checks vulnerabilities of direct dependencies, but also possible vulnerabilities in indirect dependencies (also known as transitive dependencies of the application). The resolution process respects https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/adviser/experimental_features.html#strict-index-configuration[Python package index configuration] to avoid possible https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/12/21/prevent-python-dependency-confusion-attacks-thoth#dependency_management_in_python[dependency confusion attacks].

[#run-application]
== Running the Example Application

Now that you know how Thamos prevents the use of unsafe dependencies in your application, you can revert to another version of pillow to complete this part of the tutorial. 
To launch the example application with the resolved dependencies, run (Python 3.8 is required):

[.lines_space]
[.console-input]
[source,bash]
thamos run --no-pedantic ./game_of_life.py
